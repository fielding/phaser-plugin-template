Phaser Plugin Template
======================
Personal template that I use for my Phaser 3 plugins. I use parcel, because it was the quickest and easiest (notice no parcel config file) to get up and running quickly.


*warning*: Currently, my main phaser project uses Phaser v3.24.1, so my plugins currently target that version of Phaser. Some will work fine with the latest, some have native suppoort in the latest version, and others will probably blow up with any version other than 3.24.1.
